# Netflix-Recommendation-Engine

Introduction
Welcome to the Netflix Recommendation Engine project! This project aims to develop a recommendation system for Netflix users based on their viewing history and preferences. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and data analysis techniques, I strive to deliver personalized recommendations to enhance the user experience on the platform.

Objectives
Identify Most Popular and Liked Genres: Analyze the dataset to determine the most popular and highly-rated movie genres among Netflix users.

Create Genre-Specific Recommendation Model: Develop a recommendation model that suggests the best-suited movies for each user in every genre. This model will take into account user preferences and viewing history to provide personalized recommendations tailored to individual tastes.

Analyze Genre Ratings: Explore the dataset to identify which genre movies have received the best and worst ratings based on user ratings. This analysis will help understand user preferences and sentiment towards different movie genres.

Dataset Information
The dataset contains the following columns:

ID: Contains separate keys for customers and movies.
Rating: Represents user ratings for all movies.
Genre: Highlights the category of the movie.
Movie Name: Name of the movie corresponding to the movie ID.
Getting Started
To get started with the Netflix Recommendation Engine project, follow these steps:

Download the Dataset: Obtain the Netflix dataset containing customer ratings and movie information.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the dataset, handling missing values and encoding categorical variables if necessary.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset, understand user preferences, and identify patterns.
Model Development: Implement recommendation algorithms such as collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or hybrid approaches using machine learning libraries like scikit-learn.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the recommendation models using appropriate evaluation metrics and techniques.


Acknowledgements
The training data came in 17,000+ files. In the interest of keeping files together and file sizes as low as possible, I used one combined file: combined_data_1.txt
